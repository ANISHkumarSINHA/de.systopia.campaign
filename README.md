# Campaign Manager

A CiviCRM extension to enhance functionality for fundraising and other campaigns
in CiviCRM. Read the
documentation [here](https://docs.civicrm.org/campaign/en/latest/).

> [!WARNING]
> *Campaign Manager* seems to have an incompatibility regarding the display of
> expenses with CiviCRM Core 5.39 and up. The result is that no expenses are
> being displayed. There is
> a [PR](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/27570) to CiviCRM Core to
> fix this, which is likely to be included in CiviCRM Core 5.67.
