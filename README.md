SYSTOPIA's Google Summer of Code project: CiviFundraiser. See
[description](http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRM/Google+Summer+of+Code+-+2015#GoogleSummerofCode-2015-StrategicFundraisingandCampaigning).

The component CiviCampaign provides basic functions to link contributions with
campaigns. Thus, it enables users to determine the success of a campaign e.g. in
regard to „return on investment“. Such data is most important to fundraisers in
order to evaluate and adapt their fundraising strategy.

The project aims at enhancing CiviCRM capabilities for strategic fundraising,
campaigning and reporting in the following ways:

- Providing a campaign hierarchy
- Adding campaign fields and functions
