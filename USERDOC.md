## The Campaign Dashboard
CiviFundraiser adds an extended campaign dashboard to CiviCRM

[image]

Here you can find all relevant information for a specific campaign:
1. The campaign name
2. Its parent- and child-campaings (if there are any, otherwise this area is hidden)
3. Buttons to
    1. View the *Campaign Tree*, a visualization of the campaign relationships
    2. Edit the current campaign
    3. Create a sub-campaign of the current one
    4. Clone the current campaign with or without all of its sub-campaigns (This keeps the relationship of all campaigns in a specific sub-tree and creates a copy of it.)
4. The quick information panel, that shows campaign status information, like
   1. Campaign Status
   2. Wherether it is *active* or *disabled*
   3. The external identifier
   4. *Start-* and *end date* of the campaign
   5. A "Apply to Children"-Button, that applies the respective campaign attribute to **all sub-campaigns**. Be careful when using this as there is currently no option to reverse this operation. In case of doubt use the *Clone Tool* to create a copy of a campaign first.
5. The *Campaign Information*-Section, that contains the
    1. Campaign Description
    2. Campaign Goals
6. The *Key Performance Indicator*-Section
7. The *Campaign Expense*-Section
